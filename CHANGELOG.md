**Duration**: ~1.5 hours (estimated 5.5 days, high parallelization)  
**Tasks Completed**: M1.1 through M1.12 (12/12)

#### Infrastructure
- Monorepo structure established (apps/, packages/, build/, docs/spec/)
- Python 3.11+ toolchain: FastAPI, ruff, mypy, pytest with 100% coverage
- Node.js 20 toolchain: React 18, TypeScript 5, Vite 6, Vitest, ESLint strict
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions workflows for lint/test/security (pip-audit, npm audit, license check)
- Pre-commit hooks: Quality gates enforcing ruff/mypy/eslint/tsc before commit

#### Services
- Backend: 5 FastAPI microservices (gateway, metadata, playback, voice, search)
- Shared health module: GET /healthz and GET /version endpoints
- Frontend: Electron 31 + React 18 app with main/preload/renderer architecture
- All services pass type checks, linting, and unit tests

#### Deployment
- Dockerfile: Debian Bookworm base for Pi OS Lite, Python + Node + Kodi + GPU drivers
- docker-compose.yml: Full stack with 6 services (5 WomCast + Ollama)
- Environment config: 157-line .env.template with all service settings
- Documentation: Comprehensive README with setup/deployment/troubleshooting

#### Quality Assurance
- Test coverage: Python 100% (2 tests), Node.js 100% (3 tests)
- Static analysis: ruff (E/W/F/I/B/C4/UP), mypy (strict), eslint (TypeScript strict)
- Security: Automated audits fail on high/critical CVEs
- ASBUILT.md: Living document with 5 deviations documented
